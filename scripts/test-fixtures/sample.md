# Introduction

This chapter introduces fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics.
Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence is given by the inline expression
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ (Pythagorean theorem), and $E = mc^2$ (mass-energy equivalence).

A classic result in analysis is the Gaussian integral:

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

This integral arises naturally in probability theory and Fourier analysis.

# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra provides the language of modern machine learning and physics.
Consider the rotation matrix in two dimensions, where $\theta$ is the angle:

$$R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}$$

More generally, for any square matrix $A$, the characteristic polynomial
$\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ determines eigenvalues $\lambda$.

# Calculus

The Riemann zeta function evaluated at $s = 2$ gives the famous Basel problem:

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

The derivative of the sine function satisfies $\frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = \cos(x)$,
a result provable from the limit definition. More generally, the fundamental
theorem of calculus connects differentiation and integration.
