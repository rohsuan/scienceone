<objective>
Verify all three simulations end-to-end using Rodney browser automation — confirm gallery, detail pages, interactivity, responsiveness, and content display.

Purpose: Automated browser verification confirms that Plan 13-01 fixes actually work in a real browser, catching any remaining hydration errors, canvas rendering issues, or broken interactive controls.

Output: Verified working simulation system with all phase success criteria confirmed.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify simulation gallery, detail pages, and interactivity with Rodney</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Start the dev server if not running (`npm run dev`).

    Use Rodney to perform the following browser verification sequence:

    **1. Gallery page verification (SIM-01):**
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/simulations`
    - Confirm the page loads without errors (no server error page, no blank page)
    - Confirm three simulation cards are visible (Projectile Motion, Wave Interference, Spring-Mass)
    - Take a screenshot for documentation
    - Test subject filtering: click "Physics" filter if present, confirm simulations still show

    **2. Projectile Motion detail page (SIM-02, SIM-05, SIM-06):**
    - Click the Projectile Motion card to navigate to its detail page
    - Confirm the canvas renders (a canvas element is visible, not a loading skeleton or error)
    - Confirm the "Teacher Guide" section is visible with learning objectives text
    - Confirm the "Parameter Documentation" section is visible in the sidebar
    - Confirm the breadcrumb shows "Simulations / Projectile Motion Simulator"
    - Check browser console for errors — report any hydration mismatches or JS errors

    **3. Projectile Motion interactivity (SIM-06):**
    - Move the Angle slider — confirm the label updates
    - Move the Velocity slider — confirm the label updates
    - Click "Launch" — confirm the projectile animates across the canvas
    - Click "Reset" — confirm the canvas returns to initial state
    - Click "Show Code" — confirm the Python code block appears with current parameter values

    **4. Wave Interference detail page (SIM-02, SIM-06):**
    - Navigate to the Wave Interference simulation detail page
    - Confirm the canvas renders with the animated interference pattern
    - Confirm the interference pattern is visually animating (not static)
    - Move the Frequency slider — confirm the pattern changes
    - Move the Separation slider — confirm the fringe spacing changes
    - Click "Pause" — confirm animation stops
    - Click "Play" — confirm animation resumes
    - Confirm Teacher Guide and Parameter Docs sections are present

    **5. Spring-Mass detail page (SIM-02, SIM-06):**
    - Navigate to the Spring-Mass simulation detail page
    - Confirm the canvas renders with the animated spring-mass system
    - Confirm the mass block is oscillating (displacement trail is growing)
    - Move the Mass slider — confirm the oscillation frequency changes
    - Move the Spring k slider — confirm the oscillation changes
    - Click "Pause" — confirm animation stops
    - Click "Reset" — confirm the system returns to initial displacement
    - Confirm Teacher Guide and Parameter Docs sections are present

    **6. Responsive canvas verification (SIM-04):**
    - On any simulation detail page, resize the browser to 375px width
    - Confirm the canvas shrinks to fit the viewport without horizontal scrolling
    - Confirm the simulation content (projectile, interference pattern, or spring) is still visible and not clipped
    - Resize to 768px width — confirm the canvas renders at a reasonable intermediate size
    - Resize back to desktop (1280px) — confirm the canvas returns to full size

    **7. Admin page verification:**
    - Navigate to `/admin/resources` and click edit on any simulation resource
    - Confirm the page loads without server errors (verifies the SIMULATION_KEYS import fix)
    - Confirm the simulation tab shows the component key dropdown

    Report any failures with specific error messages and screenshots.
  </action>
  <verify>
    All verification steps above pass. Rodney confirms: gallery loads with 3 cards, all detail pages render canvases, sliders change parameters, Play/Pause/Reset work, canvas is responsive at 375px and 768px, teacher guide and parameter docs are visible, admin page loads without errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All five phase success criteria are confirmed via automated browser testing: (1) gallery loads with filtering and shows all simulations, (2) detail pages render canvases without errors, (3) all three simulations have working interactive controls, (4) canvas scales correctly at phone and tablet viewports, (5) teacher guide and parameter docs appear.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All phase 13 success criteria verified via Rodney browser automation:
1. Gallery page loads with subject filtering — 3 simulation cards visible
2. Detail pages render canvas without hydration or console errors
3. All 3 simulations interactive — sliders and controls work
4. Canvas responsive at 375px and 768px — no overflow or hardcoded sizing
5. Teacher guide and parameter docs display on each detail page
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Rodney confirms all five phase success criteria pass without manual intervention
- No console errors, no hydration mismatches, no server-side errors
- Screenshots captured for documentation
</success_criteria>
