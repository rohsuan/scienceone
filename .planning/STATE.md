## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Ingest pipeline is Phase 2 (before catalog/reader) — highest-risk dependency; every feature depends on correctly ingested content with pre-rendered KaTeX math
- [Roadmap]: Auth split from admin dashboard — AUTH-01/02 in Phase 1 (foundation), AUTH-03/04 (My Library, receipt email) in Phase 5 (payments) where they are first needed
- [Roadmap]: ADM-07 (citation export) placed in Phase 8 — academic polish feature, does not block revenue path

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2 readiness]: KaTeX vs MathJax decision must be made before Phase 2 begins — audit manuscripts for \label/\eqref cross-reference usage; if heavy, switch to MathJax v3
- [Phase 2 readiness]: LaTeX package allowlist (amsmath, amsthm, tikz, physics, pgfplots) unknown until first real manuscript is processed; build allowlist during Phase 2
