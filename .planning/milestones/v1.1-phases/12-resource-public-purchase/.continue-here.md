- [CRITICAL]: React.lazy in simulation registry causes server-side errors — fix in Phase 13

</blockers>

<context>
v1.1 work pattern: all features have first-pass code already written. Work is verification and bug-fix, not greenfield. No new npm packages needed. Build order follows: Infrastructure → Resource Admin → Resource Public/Purchase → Simulations → Blog → Polish.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:plan-phase` for Phase 12 (Resource Public and Purchase). This will trigger research, then planning. Key items to address: resource listing page, free downloads, Stripe purchase flow, and the critical Stripe webhook routing fix.
