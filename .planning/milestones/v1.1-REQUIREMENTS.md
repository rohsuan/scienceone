# Requirements: ScienceOne

**Defined:** 2026-02-22
**Core Value:** Educators and students can discover STEM content — books, resources, simulations, and articles — with properly rendered math, directly in their browser

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.1 Content Hub. Each maps to roadmap phases.

- **DESIGN-03**: Stats bar with animated counters (social proof)

### Content Expansion

- **CONTENT-01**: Courses section with landing pages
- **CONTENT-02**: Newsletter signup with email platform integration (ConvertKit/Beehiiv)
- **CONTENT-03**: About page with mission and founder story
- **CONTENT-04**: Additional simulations (electric field, orbital mechanics, Fourier analysis)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Rich text editor for blog (TipTap) | Raw HTML textarea sufficient for founder-managed content |
| Real-time simulation collaboration | Complexity outweighs value for solo-authored sims |
| Comments/discussion on blog posts | Deferred; no moderation infrastructure yet |
| LMS integration (LTI 1.3) | Future — university partnerships not started |
| Subscription model | Insufficient content catalog; revisit at 50+ resources |
| Additional simulations beyond 3 | Ship existing 3 first; add more in future milestone |
