## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Author self-service portal | Founder manages all content; curator model preserves quality |
| DRM / copy protection | Academic STEM audience resents DRM; use watermarking instead |
| Subscription / all-access model | Insufficient catalog size (<20 books); revisit at 50+ books |
| Social features (reviews, ratings) | STEM credibility comes from author reputation, not user ratings |
| Real-time collaborative annotation | High complexity; ship single-user highlights first |
| LMS integration (Canvas, Moodle) | Significant engineering effort; defer until institutional deal |
| AI chatbot / ask-a-question | RAG over math content produces dangerous hallucinations |
| Native mobile app | Web-first; responsive design covers mobile |
| Offline reading mode | PDF download serves the offline need |
